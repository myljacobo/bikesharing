# bikesharing

## Overview

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal by providing the information and visualizations from the bike-sharing program in New York for reference. The trip analysis provided an in depth look at the usage of the bikes for all riders.

## Summary

### Results with Additional Suggested Visualizations 

Overall the provided bike trip analysis via visualizations in Tableau Public prove that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. The total number of bike rides alone from the month of August 2019 is a staggering number that will definitely convince the investors that this pilot will be successful. One fact to consider is that gender does play a major factor in rides. The data shows that users who declared their gender as male do dominate the usage of the bikes. Data usage also shows to be more frequent during the week in the morning and afternoon rush hours which goes to show that most people are using the bikes to commute to and from work or school and they are not only used as a tool for tourism and will be successfull regardless of tourism peaks. Weekend hours from 10am-8pm do show a constant high usage. The bike data from NYC with the starting and ending locations do suggest that these high tourist spots may help to increase the bike usage. 

I feel that a visualization based on age by gender could also provide more insight into the marketing that the investors may want to do or analyze the same age and gender group in Des Moines. The data shows that males prove to be the most users but is there an age group that has a higher usage. Another visualization that may be helpful would be the data from the heaviest used start and end station names and id's. This graph would be helpful in determining the number of stations needed for a certain population or heavy tourist location.
